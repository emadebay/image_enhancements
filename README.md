Implementation of several image enhancements techniques
gaus_ave.py: implementation from scratch using gaussian averaging to remove addded noise to an image
hist_equi.py: histogram equilization implementation to improve image
log_trans.py: implementation of logarithm transformation to enhance image
median_filter.py: using median averaging to remove noise from image. It does almost same thing as gaussian averaging but it does not preserve edges
